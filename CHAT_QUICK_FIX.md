# 🔧 Chat Feature - FIXED!

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed:

### 1. **WebSocket Connection URL** ✅
**Problem:** WebSocket was trying to connect to `https://ridemate-51.onrender.com` (production) instead of `http://localhost:5000`

**Fixed:** Changed default URL to `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. **API Method Calls** ✅  
**Problem:** Using `api.get()` which doesn't exist

**Fixed:** Changed to `api.request()`
